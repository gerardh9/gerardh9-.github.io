This zip contains these diferent type of files: HTML,CSS,JS,PNG

The html file is the implementation of the hangman game, in the CSS file you can find
the styles we used. There are two Java Script files, one defines an array of words used
to spawn a random word while starting a game. The other JS has all the functions in order
to make the elements work. PNG's are the hangman drawings.
